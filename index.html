	<h2>Dark Saints</h2>
        <p>Dark Saints was a record that was melodramatic and tense in its delivery. It relied heavily on organic instrumentation and didn't include any programmic whatsoever.</p>
        <h2>Harder to Love</h2>
        <p>Harder to Love is a new record that has a more present, dynamic and modern production style with better songwriting and a more accessible sound to a wider audience.</p>
